# What's This

This is for taking SHP files for GIS, exported from Shape Viewer (from shapeviewer.com) to excel, and from there to CSV, and turning them into SVG vector files.  This isn't perfect at all.

Dependencies:

* Python
* svgcuts (https://github.com/eastein/svgcuts)

# How To

    PYTHONPATH=../git:$PYTHONPATH python csv_map_writer.py ~/Desktop/Wards.csv



This isn't perfect at all.  In fact, it's a mess.  If you care tell me so I make it nicer.
